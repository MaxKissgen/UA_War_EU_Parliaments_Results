# Impact of the Ukraine War on Influence and Communities in European Parliaments on Twitter
This repository provides all (publicly available) results of the masters thesis "European Parliaments On Twitter during the Ukraine War: Analyzing Parliamential Influentials and Communities over Time".

The repository is structured as follows:
	- **Graphs** contain all fetched politician networks for the complete time period as well as the time period for the beginning of the invasion and that for China's peace plan and the Leopard deliveries.
	- **Communities** similarly contains all generated covers for these time periods and algorithms SLPA, DMID and NISE. We again note that NISE did not yield interpretable results.
	- **Centralities** similarly contains all generated centralities for these time periods and centralities Degree, Harmonic In-Closeness, Betweenness and SIR. We again note that SIR did not yield interpretable results.
	- **Twitter Metrics** contains follower numbers, tweets numbers, and the generated average response botness and average response bot maliciousness values for politicians. In the **Hashtags** folder, there then are occurrence numbers for the found hashtags in the tweets
	- **Parliaments** contains the parliaments we collected from Wikidata along with politicians Wikidata IDs and twitter handles.
